# Python_naver_crawler

A administrator at KU education college requests me to crawl phone numbers of several mid and high schools.

So i made a python script to do that.

The list of schools is stored in 'school.txt'. Names are sepearted by new_line delimeters.

The result will be stored in 'pn.txt' which implies the phone number.

If the result doesn't include a phone number at the query, the program become dead. there is no exception hanling.
